# Performance Budget Builder
This easy-to-use tool allows you to scan a URL and view the size of the assets that make up your webpage.

You can then set a size budget for your page, plugging in sizes for each asset category that will load on the page. The tool will adjust each categoryâ€™s width accordingly and yell at you if you exceed your budget.

## Dependencies
* [gulp] (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
* [Google API key] (https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v1/getting_started#auth)

## Usage
You will need to specify a [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v2/first-app#auth) for Pagespeed Insights API. Once generated, place that into JS file, `pageSpeedService.js`

    var API_KEY = 'YOURAPIKEYGOES HERE';


Build out `pageSpeedService.js` by navigating to the root directory of this project and running `gulp` on the command line

    $ gulp


The application is invoked purely through JavaScript and leverages a callback via JSONP, hence no server-side code.
